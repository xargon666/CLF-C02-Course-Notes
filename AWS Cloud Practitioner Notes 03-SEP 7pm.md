## Cloud Use Cases
The cloud is used for a lot of things, and offers significant advantages, allowing business to focus on their products/services instead of buying the servers and infrastructure that amazon already provide for cheap. 
#### Advantages
- Instant Scaling
- Cost efficiency
- High Availabilty
- Redundancy
- Fault tolerance
- Security
- Easy to expand services globally
- A shift from capital to variable expenses: you don't need to buy and maintain the hardware!
- Access to all sorts of services and apps on demand
#### Elastic Beanstalk
No, don't laugh, that's what they named it, on purpose!
*Note: I have no idea what this is*
## The Shocking, Terrible Alternative! (According to Amazon)
The alternative is.... something called On-Prem-Isis Computing, which might be a form of terrorism.
### Advantages
- Bezos doesn't get your money
- You might not need to deploy an application in Dubai, New York and London at the same time
- My RaspberyPi server is just fine thank you very much
- You have total, absolute control of your own hardware/software/data
### Disadvantages
- Bezos will know...
- Scalability costs money
- Not very responsive to demand i.e. you can't actually download more ram
- Might be more expensive in the long run (man they are really hammering this home)

# Cloud Terms
## Software as a Service (SaaS)
Do you want your application's responsiveness to rely solely on your web browser and internet connection? Well tough, because everything is SaaS now.

SaaS has a lot of advantages, like being slow and frustrating, doesn't require installation, it works pretty much everywhere, and so deployment and maintenance is easy.
## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
This is the big scalability part... Amazon will provide the hardware in the form of virtual machines, renting chunks of their server hardware.
## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
This is the means by which those cloud services can be delivered; Amazon may provide a suite of tools for creating/serving a website, database etc... in one user friendly package or platform.

# AWS technologies
## Examples
Amazon EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
Amazon S3 - something else
Databases - They have a lot of different types
AI probably? yup there it is
Amazon SageMaker - Machine Learning, easy to use apparently
AWS IoT - "Internet of Things" 
AWS Lambda - Something about servers and application development
## Who uses them?
- Netlflix *(failing business model)*
- AirBnB *(falling stock price)*
- Slack *(nobody likes slack)*
- Nasa *(haven't taken us to the moon since the 60's)*
- lyft *(heard of them? me neither)*
- And many more!
